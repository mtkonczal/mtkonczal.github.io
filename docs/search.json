    "text": "This is a tool to visualize the distribution of price inflation for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE). It was last updated for September, 2023. All values are seasonally-adjusted and annualized.\n \nYou can right-click on the graphic to save it. Notes:\n1. CPI Distribution:\n\nItem Categories: The CPI distribution encompasses a total of 179 unique and non-overlapping item categories.\nCoverage: These categories collectively account for approximately 85 percent of the total consumer basket, offering a broad spectrum analysis of consumer expenditure patterns.\nRegional Housing Data: Unlike methodologies employed by the Cleveland Fed, our current CPI distribution does not differentiate housing data by region (while applying new seasonal adjustments). This limitation means our housing data may present less dispersion (see more here).\n\n2. PCE Distribution:\n\nItem Categories: The PCE distribution is detailed, featuring 131 distinct, non-overlapping item categories.\nCoverage: These items are classified under a ‘level 4’ categorization system, indicating a structure organized with four sets of indentations for nuanced analysis. The PCE distribution is exhaustive, representing around 100 percent of the consumer basket, thereby providing a complete overview of consumer spending.\n\n3. Notes Distribution:\n\nYou can access the underlying distribution data here.\n“Exclude Top/Bottom Percent” (currently) is by the unweighted percent number of items, not by their expenditure weights (contrasted with the 16 percent trimmed-mean CPI, which excludes the top and bottom 8 percent of expenditures)."

A powerful polemic.”\n- Martin Wolf, Financial Times\n“By identifying an alternative grammar, one that is grounded in the American past, Freedom from the Market provides a way out of the political cul-de-sac created by the failure of the market to deliver on its promises of ‘freedom.’”\n- Molly Michelmore, Democracy: A Journal of Ideas\n“Freedom from the Market is an impressive book, easily one of the best I’ve read in the past several years. I cannot recommend it highly enough.”\n- Matt Mazewski, Commonweal\n“terrific book.”\n- Jamelle Bouie, New York Times\n“Freedom from the Market has the potential to be a very important book, focusing attention on the contested, messy but crucially important intersection between social movements and the state. It provides a set of ideas that people on both sides of that divide can learn from, and a lively alternative foundation to the deracinated technocratic notions of politics, in which good policy would somehow, magically, be politically self supporting, that has prevailed up until quite recently. Strongly recommended.”\n—Henry Farrell, Crooked Timber"

    "text": "CPI Inflation report for September, 2023\nGenerated: October 24, 2023.\nBLUF: About what people are expecting, higher shelter but negative goods, both likely to revert. I think we can say that the rate of deceleration is decelerating, but as shelter continues to slow (as rental units in particular come online) there’s a very clear path in these numbers to the full soft landing.\n(Code to download BLS flat files and generate these graphics is here.)\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall core inflation continues to fall in 2023. The levels during June and July were actually at prepandemic levels, which themselves were below trend. Some reversal was expected; recent inflation is somewhere between 3.1 and 3.6 percent, whether it’s the 3 or 6 month average.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fed watches three elements - core goods, housing, and the rest of services. It does this assuming core goods inflation was transitory, and, after shocking numbers in 2021-2022, would eventually return to a trend near zero. It also notes housing is measured with a lag, but that, in their minds, the rest of services is more labor and wage intensive and could be more persistent.\nThis month saw a pop in housing that is unlikely to be continued, especially as more rental units come online.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have six months now of core goods inflation excluding volatile used car prices back at zero. That part of inflation appears to be over.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking beyond that, we can see how PCE (one the Fed uses) and CPI are going to diverge - medical care drove an big part of number, but that is measured differently (and better) for PCE.\nOverall remains steady, if a little hot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big energy run-up we saw last month is decelerating. Bodes well for keeping supply-shocks low.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe density plot of a cross section of price changes looks really good. Very close to pre-pandemic levels.\nThis change isn’t being driven by outliers or where categorization - the actual distribution of price changes is reverting back, even while the economy grows.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew thing I’m watching, inspired by Paul Romer’s blog: monthly evolution of seasonally unadjusted core inflation across the year.\nPrice increases are generally biggest in January. In 2022 they stayed elevated across the year; 2023 is converging back to 2019 levels. That’s a good developement."
