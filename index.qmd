Mike Konczal is the Senior Director of Policy and Research at the [Economic Security Project](https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/), where he oversees policy development, research, and strategic analysis to build economic power for all Americans. Previously, he served as a Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Chief Economist at the National Economic Council.

He was an early hire at the Roosevelt Institute, where he led major projects on financial reform, inequality, economic ideas, and macroeconomics. He authored *Freedom from the Market: America's Fight to Liberate Itself from the Grip of the Invisible Hand,* described by the *Financial Times* as "a powerful polemic," and co-authored *Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy* with Joseph Stiglitz.

Described as having "a cult following among progressives" by *The New York Times Magazine* and specializing in economic data analysis and policy research, Mike is a respected voice in U.S. economic discourse, frequently cited in media outlets, and has provided testimony before Congress.

Here are some of the latest things he's been doing; you can find the full list of [writings](https://www.mikekonczal.com/writings.html) and [media](https://www.mikekonczal.com/appearances.html) around this website.
